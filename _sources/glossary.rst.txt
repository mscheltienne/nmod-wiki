The Glossary provides short definitions of vocabulary specific to the neuromodulation
and general neuroimaging concepts.

    anatomical landmark
    anatomical landmarks
    fiducial
    fiducial point
    fiducial points
        Fiducials are objects placed in the field of view of an imaging system to act as
        known spatial references that are easy to localize. In neuroimaging, fiducials
        are often placed on anatomical landmarks such as the `nasion (NAS) <Nasion_>`_
        or `left/right preauricular points (LPA and RPA) <LRPA_>`_.

        These known reference locations are used to define a coordinate system for
        localizing sensors (hence `NAS <Nasion_>`_, `LPA and RPA <LRPA_>`_ are often
        called "cardinal points" because they define the cardinal directions of the head
        coordinate system). The cardinal points are also useful when co-registering
        measurements in different coordinate systems.

        Due to the common neuroimaging practice of placing fiducial objects on
        anatomical landmarks, the terms "fiducial", "anatomical landmark", and "cardinal
        point" are often (erroneously) used interchangeably.

    motor threshold
        The motor threshold is defined as the minimum single pulse TMS energy needed to
        observe an Abductor Pollicis Brevis contraction (APB or muscle in the hand that
        functions as an abductor of the thumb).

        The motor threshold is measured as a percentage of the maximum stimulator output
        and is determined by discharging a magnetic coil over the motor cortex. The
        motor cortex area on the brain is used as an indicator because it's one of few
        areas in the brain where TMS is associated with easily observable phenomena.

    antenna
    coil
    magnetic coil
    TMS antenna
    TMS coil
        The coil, or antenna, is the part of the TMS system that emits the magnetic
        field. The coil is an electrical conductor in the shape of a coil, in which an
        electrical current is passed through to generate a magnetic field.
